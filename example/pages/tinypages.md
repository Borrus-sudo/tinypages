# Tinypages [text-red-500]

## To showcase the features of Tinypages

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

### Adding Values

```ts {"name":"main"}
const a = 1;
// - 1
const b = 2;
// - 2
const c = 3;
```

Let's talk a bit about `a`:

`a` can be added to another number

```ts
const nextA = a + 13;
```

Look what happens when you add `a + b`

```ts {"include":"main-2"}
const result = a + b;
```

Finally here is :

```ts {"include":"main"}
c.toString();
```
